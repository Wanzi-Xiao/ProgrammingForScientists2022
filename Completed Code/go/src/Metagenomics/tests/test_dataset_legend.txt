Richness:

0. Normal case -- small number of keys, positive values
1. One of the keys has a zero value
2. A single element with a positive value
3. Duplicate keys


Simpsons Index:

0. Normal case
1. Map has only one key -- simpsons index = 1
2. One value is zero
3. All values are equal -- 1/n for richness = n
4. Imbalanced values, with one key having high value
5. Same as normal case but with different ordering of keys


Bray Curtis:
0. Normal case (same number of keys)
1. Identical maps -- distance = 0
2. No shared keys -- distance = 1
3. There are shared keys but values = 0 for them in one map
4. Map 1 is a subset of map 2.
5. Map 2 is a subset of map 1.

Jaccard:
0. Normal case (same number of keys)
1. Identical maps -- distance = 0
2. No shared keys -- distance = 1
3. There are shared keys but values = 0 for them in one map
4. Map 1 is a subset of map 2.
5. Map 2 is a subset of map 1.
